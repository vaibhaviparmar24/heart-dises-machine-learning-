Project Title: Predicting Heart Disease Risk Using Machine Learning


Project Description:
This project aims to predict the risk of heart disease in individuals using machine learning techniques. By leveraging a dataset containing various health parameters, the project builds a predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at risk of heart disease, enabling timely intervention and management.

Objectives:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Load the dataset from a CSV file.
Check for and handle any missing values.
Encode categorical variables if necessary.
Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
Data Splitting:

Split the data into training and testing sets, using 80% for training and 20% for testing, ensuring reproducibility with a fixed random state.
Data Standardization:

Standardize the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 using StandardScaler.
Model Training:

Train a Random Forest classifier with 100 trees on the training data.
Model Prediction:

Use the trained model to predict class labels (y_pred) and probabilities (y_prob) on the test set.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.
Generate and display the confusion matrix.
Plot the confusion matrix, distribution of the target variable, feature importance, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve.
Results Visualization:

Visualize the distribution of the target variable and feature importance.
Plot the ROC curve and the precision-recall curve to analyze the model's performance.
Prediction for New Patients:

Provide a method to predict heart disease risk for new patients by standardizing their data and making predictions using the trained model.
Tools and Technologies:
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
Expected Outcomes:
A trained Random Forest model capable of predicting heart disease risk based on health data.
Visualization of important features contributing to the prediction.
Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
Methods for predicting heart disease risk in new patients.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in healthcare, specifically for predicting heart disease risk. By analyzing various health parameters, the developed model can aid in early detection and prevention, potentially saving lives and improving patient outcomes.
